This paper proposes a dust sensor monitoring system using Wi-Fi mesh network, including wireless dust sensor node and Wi-Fi mesh networking procedure. The wireless sensor node is made by integrating a dust sensor based on GP2Y1010AU0F chip, a STM32F103ZET6 chip as its MCU, a Wi-Fi module as its wireless transceiver, and a LCD screen as its user-interface. The dust sensor takes the light scattering method, measuring the flash frequency and the duration reflected by particles in the air flow. Dust sensor nodes are networking by Wi-Fi mesh network. Practical experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed system. The measuring error of dust concentration is less than 5%. As the network is made up of 8-10 nodes, if the root node is disconnected, the network recovery time is less than 9 seconds while the other nodes' is less than 5 seconds.
