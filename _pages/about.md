I'm a third year graduate student from [School of Cyber Science and Engineering](https://cse.hust.edu.cn/), [Huazhong University of Science and Technology](https://www.hust.edu.cn/). I expecte to graduate in July 2025 and I am applying to a PhD candidate. My research interest includes FPGA architectures and applications, computer architecture, and machine learning.

I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Liangqi Gui](http://sinc-lab.cse.hust.edu.cn/info/1014/1034.htm) of Research Center of 6G Mobile Communications from [School of Cyber Science and Engineering](https://cse.hust.edu.cn/), Huazhong University of Science and Technology.

I embrace the open-source community, for instance, I reproduced some amazing open-source projects and benefit from them. I also like to summarize my projects to be open-source and share my learning notes on the blog part.

You can find my full CV here: [Zeyu Guo's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/CV.pdf).
