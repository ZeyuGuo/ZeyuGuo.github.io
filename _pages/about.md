Welcome to my website! I'm a third year graduate student from [School of Cyber Science and Engineering](https://cse.hust.edu.cn/), [Huazhong University of Science and Technology](https://www.hust.edu.cn/). I expecte to graduate in July 2025 and I am applying to a PhD candidate.

I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Liangqi Gui](http://sinc-lab.cse.hust.edu.cn/info/1014/1034.htm) of Research Center of 6G Mobile Communications from [School of Cyber Science and Engineering](https://cse.hust.edu.cn/), Huazhong University of Science and Technology.

I am deeply passionate about all aspects of FPGA technology, including architectures, AI acceleration, high-precision measurement systems, and automated FPGA Continuous Integration & Deployment (CI/CD). My thesis focuses on designing and developing a high-resolution timing generation and measurement system, culminating in a successful FPGA-based proof-of-concept. Additionally, I built my own FPGA CI/CD pipeline to streamline workflows and enhance development efficiency.

Beyond my thesis, I enjoy exploring how to optimize FPGA configurations for high-performance computing, with a particular emphasis on maximizing the computational efficiency of arithmetic units in FPGA architectures. I have also gained hands-on experience with state-of-the-art open-source frameworks, such as hls4ml and LUT-based deep neural networks, further deepening my expertise in FPGA-based AI acceleration.

Overall, I am enthusiastic about new technologies and enjoy experimenting with new tools and projects. In particular, I find it fascinating to explore, study, evaluate and integrate cutting-edge ideas and technologies with the state-of-the-art.

I embrace the open-source community, for instance, I reproduced some amazing open-source projects and benefit from them. I enjoy summarizing my projects into open-source contributions and documenting my learning experiences on my blog.
