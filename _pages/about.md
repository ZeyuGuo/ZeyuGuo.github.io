I'm a third year graduate student from [School of Cyber Science and Engineering](https://cse.hust.edu.cn/), [Huazhong University of Science and Technology](https://www.hust.edu.cn/). My research interest includes FPGA architectures and applications, computer architecture and machine learning.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Liangqi Gui](http://sinc-lab.cse.hust.edu.cn/info/1014/1034.htm) of Research Center of 6G Mobile Communications from [School of Cyber Science and Engineering](https://cse.hust.edu.cn/), Huazhong University of Science and Technology.
